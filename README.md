# lab - React Native 


- Create your first native phone/device application using React Native, tapping into at least 2 phone features.

### Phase 1 :

-  Focus on getting your dev system up and operational, getting “proof of life” and reaching your MVP in terms of baseline functionality


Over the next 2 lab coding sessions, you will create your first Phone App. What it does and how it looks is up to you. This is an opportunity to play around with whats possible in React Native and to get a feel for how you can get into the various device features.

This is a 2-session assignment, after which you will live-demo your phone app to the class (at the start of class 43)
